# BataBase Exam Project
This is a simple project for a University Database Exam. We were tasked with creating a functional MySQL Database with a Java-based user interface for a hypothetical client, along with all the necessary documentation.

- The database should include specific characteristics in the Entity-Relationship Schema, such as: multivalued attributes, derived attributes, three or more entities, reified entities, etc.
- The user interface should allow users to perform insertions, deletions, and alterations in at least one table.

We focused on a hypothetical transport company that needs to manage its vehicles and workers.
